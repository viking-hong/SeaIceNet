# About me

This is the first work I completed. There are still a lot of shortcomings in code writing, model design, experiment design and paper writing. If possible, I hope you can give me more advice.

# Data
Due to data confidentiality issues, it will not be disclosed for the time being. And since the weight size of this work is more than 100M, please contact viking_hazard@163.com if you need it.

At present, Sentinel-2 sea ice change detection data set has been completed, and will be released after the work is completed and published. Please pay attention to it.
